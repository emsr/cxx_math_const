This project collects various ideas about mathematical constants for C++.

The main effort now is to follow the effort in
[D0631R1 Math Constants](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0631r0.pdf) by Lev Minkovsky.

The file math_const.h has the latest.

The files cmath_variable_template and cmath_const.h were earlier, similar thoughts of my own.
