1. [] Implement Lev's ideas.

2. [] Comment OEIS everywhere if available and findable.

3. [] Implement multi-word constants.
      One way to view a constant implemented as an unevaluated sum of several floating-
      point values is as a polynomial in t = B^-q where B is the base of the floating-point number and 
      q <= p where p is the precision of the number.

      For double we could use full 53-bit constants and t = 2^{-53}.

      We could use 52-bit constants expressed as 13-digit hex constants
      and t = 2^{-52}.

4. [] Consider rounding.
      For the standard we need to consider this in "commitee".
      We should leave room for it in a future standard.
      We might have to say something about what you get now though.

5. [] I think the presence of invsqrt3_t and not invsqrt3_t in Lev's proposal is an oversight.
