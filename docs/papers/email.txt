All,
 
          Thank you very much for your very helpful feedback for our paper. As several participants pointed out, in San Diego LEWG held a series of votes on it, recorded as:
>> 
special short double names
7 5 4 1 1
add'l short float, long double?
0 2 7 4 2
drop float and long double constant names, move to ns of authors choice num vs. mat, move to LWG for C++20
1 9 6 1 1
<< 
           Given your input, I now interpret these votes as:
>> 

    Define double constants such as std::math::pi - YES
    Define float and long double constants such as std::math::pif - NO
    Move to namespace of authors choice num vs. mat - YES
    Move to LWG for C++20 - YES

<< 
        As the result of 2), I removed float and long double constants from the proposal and asked Daniel Krügler to upload the updated draft to the Wiki page.
 
        Perhaps with these changes, we can mark the paper as \u201cTentatively Ready\u201d?
